The American Psychological Association Publications and Communications Board Working Group on Journal Article Reporting Standards for Qualitative Research (JARS–Qual Working Group) was charged with examining the state of journal article reporting standards as they applied to qualitative research and with generating recommendations for standards that would be appropriate for a wide range of methods within the discipline of psychology.[1]Qualitative methods are increasingly prevalent and central in research training (Ponterotto, 2005a, 2005c). Qualitative designs are used for research goals, including, but not limited to, developing theory, hypotheses, and attuned understandings .[2]Research on same-sex couples has demonstrated a negative association between experiences of stigma and relationship quality.[3]Psychological science is now in a period of major transition. After almost a century ofdominance by a foundational view of empirical science, a new pluralism is sweeping thefield.[4]In The Discovery ofGrounded Theory, Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss address the equally Importantenterprise of how the discovery of theory from data—systematically obtained and analyzed in social research—can be furthered.[5] In each of four methodological domains—philosophy, methodology, practical guidelines, and sociopolitical commitments—the status of the mixed methods field is reviewed.[6] There are discursive modes of representation and complementary material representations. Eschewing quantitative representations excludes material phenomena from psychology.[7] Qualitative research analyzes data from direct fieldwork observations, in‐depth, open‐
ended interviews, and written documents .[8]Both Ways for almost two decades, feminists have engaged in a complex and charged conversation about objectivity.[9]
This accessibly written book is ideal for use in graduate courses or by practicing researchers and evaluators. The author puts the research problem at center stage, showing how mixed methods designs can fruitfully address different types of research questions.[10]
